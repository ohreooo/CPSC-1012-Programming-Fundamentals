                <p>Paramount Pictures has produced thirteen Star Trek feature films, the most recent being released in July 2016. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of the original series; the seventh film, Generations was designed as a transition from that cast to the cast of the Next Generation series; the next three films, 8 -10, focused completely on the cast of the Next Generation series. The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth films take place in an alternate timeline, officially known as the Kelvin Timeline, with a new cast playing younger versions of the original series characters and Leonard Nimoy portraying an elderly Spock.</p>
